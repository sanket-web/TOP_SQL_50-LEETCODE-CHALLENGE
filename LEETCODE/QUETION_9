Example 1:Write a solution to find all dates' id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).
Return the result table in any order.

Input: 
Weather table:
+----+------------+-------------+
| id | recordDate | temperature |
+----+------------+-------------+
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |
+----+------------+-------------+
EXPECTED Output: 
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 2  |
| 4  |
+----+

Explanation: 
In 2015-01-02, the temperature was higher than the previous day (10 -> 25).
In 2015-01-04, the temperature was higher than the previous day (20 -> 30).


-- QUERY :-

CROSS JOIN Weather today
WHERE DATEDIFF(today.recordDate,yesterday.recordDate) = 1
    AND today.temperature > yesterday.temperature;


-- OUTPUT:- 
+----+
